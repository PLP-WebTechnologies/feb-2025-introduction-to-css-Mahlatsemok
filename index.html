    <p>Nature is the natural world around us, including everything from the smallest organisms to the vastest landscapes.<br>
    It encompasses the land, oceans, skies, plants, animals, and all the ecosystems that support life. Nature is constantly evolving,<br> 
    driven by natural processes like weather, <span>climate, and geological activity, as well as the interactions between living organisms.</span>
